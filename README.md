# Login-and-Registration-System
A login and registration system programmed in C++ that utilizes password hashing so nobody but the user is able to see the password
This program does the following:
1. Allows users to register a username and password into a database (text file)
2. Once registered, the user's password will be hashed and nobody but the user will be able to know their password
3. Using the text file, the user can login using their username and password
4. Once logged in, the user has a special game they may play

Note: The main.exe and data.txt must be downloaded and be in the same folder for everything to work properly
